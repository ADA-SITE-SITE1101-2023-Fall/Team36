I expect to meet different people and make new friends while studying at ADA University. I will also learn how to get along with individuals from diverse backgrounds. Because ADA University is self-directed, it will be my responsibility to plan and organize my work, handle multiple projects and manage deadlines. This will be my first experience on managing my own schedule and taking responsibility for my work. Finally, i strongly believe that I will get sufficient knowledge and information to become programmer in the future.</p>
